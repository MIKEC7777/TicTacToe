# TicTacToe

Game of tic tac toe 2 player game where you try to get three in a row in any direction. 
Just click on the square that you want to mark it and take turns until you run out of squares or you get three in a row. 

Roadmap of Future Improvements

I would like to add more styling to the game's layout to make it more pleasing.
An interesting idea would be to implement ability to pick your mark on the gameboard.
Create a restart button so that players can restart the game at any time. 
Create a score board for players wanting to keep tract of how many times they've won.
